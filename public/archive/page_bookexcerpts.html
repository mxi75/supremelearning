<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><a name="whatk"></a>What 

  kind of sponge are you?</font></b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you can 

 see, I'm sitting here in front of a computer. What is a computer to you? Is it 

 a number-crunching machine? An aid to writing papers and documents? A video game 

 interface? Maybe your gate to the Internet? Or is it just a big -- expensive 

 -- typewriter and calculator? I ask, because I have noticed that most computer 

 owners do not use their computers in very many ways; they often have one or two 

 uses and leave it at that -- all the while using a miniscule amount of the computer's 

 power.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some people spend hours upon hours, for

example, surfing the World Wide Web. Though the Web can be an undeniably good informational

resource, it also can be a huge source of frustration. All of us who surf, know how much time it can

take to find just the right piece of information we're after. But I instead want to concentrate

right now on what happens when pertinent information is retrieved.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Take a moment to recall all

the times you've accessed Web information. How much do you recall now? And if you don't recall much

now, what was the point of your spending so much time to track it down in the first place? Do you

know why this phenomenon occurs? You might surmise, but let me lead you in the right direction.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Picture a sponge being

applied to a puddle of liquid. That sponge, quickly and easily, soaks up and holds that liquid. The

sponge, with the liquid, can then be moved to another location, and at any time, the liquid can be

drawn out of it.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But now, what if we had an

object that were identical to our sponge, and just as porous, only instead of being made of an

absorbent material, it were made of wood? Sure, the liquid would permeate through our wooden

"sponge", but it would not be retained, nor would it then be transferable to another

place.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most of us are more like that wooden

sponge than the absorbent sponge.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just like the wooden sponge, which liquid

can go all throughout, we also can take in large quantities of information. But unlike that

absorbent sponge, we do not retain that information; we haven't actually learned that information,

and thus cannot use it later. Adults are, unfortunately, especially incapable of mimicking the

absorbent sponge, to any significant degree.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why have we been created more like a piece

of wood than a sponge? Why are our brains seemingly going to waste?</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The answer lies in what 

 has formed our brains since very early on: our teaching systems.</font> 

<p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><a name="leter"></a>Let 

  error-free rule!</font></b> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The SupremeLearning 

 typing program that accompanies some SupremeLearning audio- and videotapes will 

 inevitably lead to better speaking and writing -- literally day-by-day. You don't 

 need a fancy program with lots of features that have nothing to do with learning. 

 In fact, using fancy features without having the fundamentals as described here 

 will actually hurt more than help.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the SupremeLearning typing program,

created by Gin I. Paris, a user is not allowed to proceed with writing if even a single error has

occurred. This is whether the error was noticed or unnoticed. The software stops you mid-sentence

and mid-word until you type correctly. The unnoticed errors now become very noticed. When you can't

continue, you get a special kind of idiosyncrasy -- a sort of disgust for not being able to do what

you think you should be able to do. Eventually you develop a whole motor skill of being

disgusted with creating unnoticed errors. You, no more, want even a slight possibility of leaving

mistakes unnoticed. You begin to catch the errors before they are caused. And the phenomenon spreads

to other areas such as the noticing of errors in others' reading and speaking.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In other words, this

program's exercise creates a strong negative attitude towards any mistake in written, as well as

spoken, speech. In addition, this SupremeLearning "rule" turns any person into a natural

excellent proofreader. You've heard of Garbage In / Garbage Out? Now we finally have Quality In /

Quality Out.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But there's more. In Gin I.

Paris's program, a whole line must be repeated if even one single "small" mistake has been

made -- even at the very end of the line. Your computer will not take bribes; your computer will not

allow you to offer any rationalizations; your computer is boss. But a boss that you welcome, if you

want to better your learning and even your whole approach to life.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Using the SupremeLearning

typing program simultaneously with the video- and audiocassettes of the basic SupremeLearning course

is simple and does the job of helping you eliminate the Backspace Approach. But it also develops a

kind of "finger memory", which serves, essentially, as an additional organ of sense.

Believe me, no one else is talking about these things; that's because they don't understand the

importance of error-free work being performed the first time! And it certainly hasn't been used by

anyone to master a language. But you can start now!</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why do we need to pay so much attention to

seemingly "insignificant" errors? Let's look at it again. When a child has been corrected,

the next time that child will more likely remember not to repeat the same kind of mistake again. But

when an adult makes a mistake and isn't punished for doing so, the next time, under similar

circumstances, they will repeat that mistake on a motor skill level -- subconsciously. And there

will consequently be no effective learning.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, consider an adult who gets

used to writing the word "correctly", instead of "correct", by typing

"correctly" and every time erasing the letters "ly" with the "help" of

the Backspace. Certainly there will be many situations when they will keep writing an incorrect

version instead of the correct one; the "ly" suffix is common. If they don't feel sorry

for it -- a strong enough sorry -- that attitude will propagate. Extra "ly"s will be typed

all over the place. I declare that that attitude should be nipped in the bud, stopped in its

tracks, put out to pasture!</font>

<p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><a name="discipl"></a>Disciplined 

  error correction</font></b>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We all know 

  how easy it is to use the Backspace key to remove your last mistyped characters. 

  But who wants to take the easy way out when so many things are at stake? If 

  you want to get better overall, you need to stop using the traditional usage 

  of the Backspace key, and re-focus your attention on a new unconventional way.</font> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you know you've made a typo, don't

just push the Backspace for the last mistyped characters and continue on your merry way of writing!

If you do, that same exact mistake will -- almost certainly -- be repeated. In fact, the more you

make the same mistake, the more you are training your brain to want to make that same mistake --

subconsciously, of course. So even when your conscious mind decides it doesn't want to make

mistakes, your subconscious mind, will very often win out.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now that you've heard this from me, you

can test this phenomenon on your own. You can take note of some errors that you make, either in

typing or in handwriting, and try to notice that when you do catch your errors, you have a tendency

to make the same errors over and over.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This doesn't just happen with typing; it

happens with walking into things, putting the wrong key in the keyhole, and even doing the wrong

dance step. Did anyone catch President Clinton in his 2000 State of the Union address mistakenly

saying that Vice President Gore was working to make communities more "liberal"? He meant

to say "livable". But even that obvious embarrassment wasn't enough to prevent the

President from -- <b><i>again, not 2 minutes later</i></b> -- saying, work to make communities

more "liberal" instead of "livable"! Once an error, always an error, unless

you somehow stop the propagation! Just having the will to do so is not enough.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Repeated enough, your subconscious mind

will be so used to individual mistakes that <b>you have allowed</b> to be made, that even

during proofreading sessions later, your subconscious mind will oftentimes purposefully not catch

that same error. That is, of course, since the mistake was treated as, okay, it is also considered

okay during proofreading. Taking the Backspace Approach causes each individual error to propagate

itself throughout future documents that you will create -- something like the computer viruses

that go undetected and propagate themselves unnoticed.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A practice that you can put into place

immediately is, rather than using the Backspace key on just the error, at the very least, instead,

use it to erase the mistyped characters, plus a few of the correctly typed characters immediately

preceding the mistyped characters. Then, retype the correctly typed characters and the now-corrected

mistyped characters.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To have a disciplined brain, you need to

punish it for making mistakes. In the normal sense, it seems worse to have to retype more than

"necessary". It is certainly a punishment to have to re-read, re-process, and re-type the

same text, especially the text that you had originally typed correctly. Your brain thinks it wants

to hurry and get the job done. What could be worse punishment than having to re-type already

correctly-written text just because of a single small error? The punishment doesn't seem to fit the

crime.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But it was that hurry by your brain that

caused the problem in the first place. By forcing yourself to type extra characters, not just the

ones in error, your brain rethinks the connection between all the characters, and rethinks,

subconsciously, how not-so-good-after-all it was to hurry through potentially problematic areas.

Retyping more characters than were in error, naturally causes your brain to concentrate more on the

correct letter-symbol combination. Your brain would like to not have to retype extra characters in

the future, so it begins to do everything possible to never repeat the same mistake again!</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The only way to use keyboarding for

self-development, as, for example, speeding up the process of mastering a language, is, as we have

learned, to write every word error-free. Let me say the following, dramatically, but

truthfully: it would be better to type one page in American English error-free than 500 pages with

unnoticed errors. The latter way will ruin your chances of improving your vocabulary, which must

instead be based on excellent spelling ability.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have put this theory to 

 the test, not only with myself but with multitudes of others. The research shows 

 that taking extra small precautions as you work creates results in drastically 

 different quality later.</font> 

<p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><a name="apart"></a>A 

  particular kind of self-dictation</font></b> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Developing 

 good writing (also meaning keyboarding) habits is very important, of course. 

 It's not without reason that many Ministries of Foreign Affairs host courses 

 in typing along with the mastering of native and foreign languages. Speaking 

 and writing must be used together. But that combination doesn't necessarily help 

 most students to evenly excel in both disciplines. So I've tried to connect them 

 in the most logical way and I think that I've succeeded.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When people write, they should also use a

special kind of self-dictation. In fact, typing and/or writing will help the process of your

mastering American English only if you use this certain style of self-dictation. Acquiring this new

style will help bring back your early childhood photographic memory, which allowed you to remember,

for example, whole poems. (You recall -- too many ages ago -- how some things were very easy for you

back then, don't you?) This will abstractly add a new sensory organ -- one that helps you memorize,

retain, and recall data in any language.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You cannot learn American English, just by

(inferior quality) reading, self-dictation, and writing. If you speak or write incorrectly, even if

you're only slightly off, you're wasting your time. Even one missing or one extra letter can make

all the difference -- for the worse. And one misplaced stress can mean that no one understands you

at all!</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Take the word moron. It's not a word if

you pronounce it "MOR-n" or "moor-RON". It's an actual word only if you

pronounce it with even stresses on both syllables: MOR-RON. Try saying it with a wrong stress to a

friend and see if they understand you.</font>



<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No matter whether you are reading or

keyboarding, you must slow down and stay slowed down. You must copy the text and/or narrator's voice

very precisely, trying to do everything error-free the first time.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To ease that process, first you should see

the entire sentence on the PC screen, or listen to the entire sentence on the audio- or videotape,

and only then, when you understand what needs to be copied, should you start speaking or

writing. It's virtually impossible to avoid mistakes. But the letter and sound combinations being

repeated hundreds of times will help you do better and better. There's no need to speak loudly; just

murmur. And certainly don't try to type fast.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The more precise SupremeLearning recipe is

described in written instructions and materials and should be followed exactly.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remember, till you have gone through

thousands of words you will not develop any significant intuition. You may claim you know a word

only when it is pronounced, or pronounced and written, error-free. So you generally should go

through all the audio and video materials 3 to 5 times, and only when you have very surely learned

the pronunciation, rhythm, and intonation of each (by listening and speaking simultaneously), should

you start your corresponding writing routines.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Try not to think what the 

 words mean. Doing that may increase the amount of repetitions required to develop 

 good oral skills and gain total command of your mouth muscles.</font> 

<p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><a name="gett"></a>Getting 

  off the merro-go-round of error proliferation</font></b> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oh yes, 

 errors can be a way of life. And considered the normal way of life! In Russia, 

 for example, a country of some of the world's best touch-typing courses, 

 there is a state quality standard: No dissertation author is allowed to bring 

 in their work with more than five errors per page. Typical in America, professionals 

 have a 3 percent limit of errors for overall work. In the context you and 

 I are thinking now, these rules may seem absurd, but it is unfortunately the 

 sad reality.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You've noticed, of course (or maybe you

haven't), that all novels are published with typos.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I don't want to scare you, but I still

should tell you that American English is the most difficult language in the world when it comes to

spelling and pronunciation. You have no hope of mastering it if your learning process is based from

the beginning on writing and speaking with errors, most especially if you are an adult. With that

kind of basis you are doomed to continue repeating errors. A habit is a habit -- or it wouldn't be a

habit, now would it? Making errors is like smoking or drinking. It's addictive.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At some point you'll have to come to the

realization that you can only break away from this merry-go-round development by using

SupremeLearning techniques or something else that stops the habit dead in its tracks (if anything

else does). How do you really learn American English? How do you make your brain finally feel sorry

for making an error? You need the basic SupremeLearning PC keyboarding software. Or, there are,

theoretically, other ways.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can learn to avoid errors without the

SupremeLearning software program even with handwriting. You know the main rule by now, don't you: no

mistake must go unpunished! The quality assurance of writing by hand is complicated to do on your

own, but it is possible. Most people would, at the very least, need a supervisor to help them point

out their mistakes. Because, as we've learned, it's the mistakes that are produced unknowingly that

are the main culprits. So if you do have such a teacher, tutor, or other helper, when you make

mistakes, they must point them out to you, and you must correct them immediately. You correct all

mistakes as you go, and consequently you slow down the actual speed of your writing until the level

where you can totally control the quality of the job performed is reached.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remember: never write faster than the

speed that allows you to do so error-free.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course it's going to be hard. Breaking

any habit would be. Your brain will tell you to go faster all the time. But the retraining of your

brain to hate making errors will allow you to little by little gain handwriting, or

keyboarding, speed -- a speed based on error-free work.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though using a method of error-free

handwriting is possible, and using the SupremeLearning error-free learning program with any number

of fingers is better, the fastest and most efficient way of copying the SupremeLearning texts is

with the SupremeLearning program and 10 fingers.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The subject of learning to touch-type

(which means typing without looking at your fingers) by spending 120 hours elsewhere, or just 10 ten

hours with me, is really another whole subject.)</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Without any doubt, the SupremeLearning 

 formula -- saying things perfectly and writing them down or typing them error-free 

 -- works just fine. You only need to follow these simple instructions.</font> 

<p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><a name="ake"></a>A 

  key that is the key to non-learning</font></b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have 

 plenty of time to discuss all the various aspects of the traditional teaching 

 systems in this and other books. Let's now look at just one example, the example 

 of typing. The traditional systems that are used to teach touch-typing (which 

 is typing without looking at the keyboard) are considered to be very complex.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One reason they are complex is because of

a particular super special function that representatives of the computer industry saw fit to add to

the previous process of typing -- a function that does not exist on good old typewriters. That is,

the seemingly simple button of the Backspace.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The problems that this little

innocent-seeming and helpful-acting key has produced are countless. The ramifications of this

ostensibly error-fixing button are of significant magnitude, yet no one seems at all aware of the

phenomenon. I certainly do not hear any of my colleagues speaking of this key as anything other than

a grand helpmate. Maybe they will begin now that I've brought it up. I know this may sound quite

gloomy, and possibly even unbelievable, but let's look at the inevitable consequences of the

introduction of this key and what it means to human beings, whether they be only average users or

professional programmers.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the beginning of the century, a person

who could type (the typist being a combination of a secretary and an editor) could receive a salary,

high enough to easily support a large family. When I say "a person who could type", I mean

that they produced quality output. What does quality output mean? It means no errors. Typing with

errors meant either having errors in the end results, or having to re-do the typing, which in turn

meant that the speed of creating the final results was lowered significantly. The typist/editor was

"punished" for making mistakes.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Now, keep in mind that, also then, the

general methods of teaching were not working all that well.) So a typist could keep their quality

high, if they typed without errors in the first place. The savvy typist learned, somehow, to do

this. That, my friends, was a very intriguing human being from the point of view of one in this day

and age -- it was a person who could produce error-free results the first time. That tact of

approaching typing projects, while keeping in mind the goal of producing no errors from the

beginning, no doubt propagated throughout the rest of their projects and even their whole lives.

When you think error-free, you are a whole other person from one who accepts errors as a way of

life.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What about this Backspace? What did it do?

It began allowing the phenomenon of typing with errors to become a natural event. Many of those

so-called natural events, put together, generates a whole new breed of typists: people who approach

typing, and consequently other projects and their lives, with a casual, if not haphazard, approach

to errors. They might say, "We don't need to type error-free because we can always back up and

fix anything." When humans were no longer being punished for errors, the quality of first-time

data creating, data entry, and data processing dropped drastically.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whereas any kind of work that involved

using your fingers, eyes, ears, or speech with computer-like qualities had always required a

prolonged period of time, now, anyone could begin doing it right off the bat. The quality of

the new generation's work, however, suffered the consequences.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you use that "Backspace

Approach" and your body and mind get used to its always being available, it makes it absolutely

impossible to assure the end quality of any intellectual product. Because now you've trained

yourself, possibly with the help of others, to not worry about doing things correctly.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Are you more careful in 

 preparing for examinations when you know you only get one shot and that's it, 

 or when you know you can take the exam over again and again? And which of these 

 two situations has an overall better outcome of results and your time spent: 

 studying and preparing very hard before your one exam? Or studying somewhat and 

 preparing a bit before your first exam, then studying a bit more and preparing 

 a bit more for a second exam, and so on?</font> 

<p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><a name="amyth"></a>A 

  myth of mastering foreign or native languages and typing</font></b> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After all 

 is said and done, how can computer keyboarding speed up the process of mastering 

 a foreign or native language? Does our learned Backspace Approach matter? I ask, 

 because there is a large variety of programs on the market today that promise 

 to allow you to learn a foreign language with the help of typing. But I declare: 

 typing, or writing by hand for that matter, native or foreign words will 

 help you master a language only if you do it on a totally error-free basis. But 

 note that no so-called language-learning experts are saying this.</font>



<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Backspace Approach has badly damaged

the process of mastering a language. If you feel comfortable saying things wrong the first time,

knowing you can fix your errors of speech later, why not go ahead and feel comfortable saying things

wrong the second time? How many times will it take before you don't feel comfortable saying things

wrong? Or are you actually teaching your brain, albeit unconsciously, that saying things wrong is of

little consequence?</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I often give lectures to people dealing

with computers, professionally, and the Backspace Approach problem is routinely explained. I admit

that I can speak for sometimes forty-five minutes on the topic and still have trouble helping half

of my audience members understand how dangerous the Backspace actually is.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The idea is really pretty 

 simple, so once you get past the seeming oddness of it, you will not only understand 

 the Backspace Approach, but also understand many negative, related cause and 

 effects.</font>

<p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><a name="errorspr"></a>Errors 

  proliferate beyond yourself</font></b> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most of us form that "great" 

  habit of leaving unnoticed errors early in life, and it becomes more deeply 

  rooted as time passes. Our reliance on "Uncle Ben" or "Sister Martha" doing 

  our proofreading -- sometime after the "work" has been performed -- only gets 

  stronger.</font> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We enter into the workforce and our habit

proliferates further, for now we are grouped with others of the same habit. And we have impact on

people other than ourselves because we begin manufacturing products and services for the public. A

software house, full of error-prone software engineers and managers, hardly thinks twice about

developing and distributing a software package with known errors, for they know it is expected -- by

in-house company employees and the general public -- that they will be working frantically to fix

the software "bugs" for months on end.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why take the time and make the effort to

fix errors before dispatching the software packages to users, when you can become known for

generating a new computer application every few months or so, and always fix bugs later? It's a

widespread expected process, industry-wide, isn't it? One firm of which I'm aware gets a new program

out the door about every month and then spends up to 6 months mopping up the aftermath of bugs. They

think nothing of it!</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oh, it can also be good for business --

these errors. You can make more than chunk change by charging for bug fixing and software

"upgrades".</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But one day -- mark my words -- the public

is going to wake up and smell the coffee. They will begin to demand quality products on the first go

'round. But don't misinterpret my blame. Those software engineers and managers, and other company

product and service developers are not to blame as a class. For those people, are you. They sell

less than the best quality items to you, and you sell other less than the best quality

items back to them. Everyone is a client for another. We all play different roles at different

times. And we're all in this together. It's going to take a revolution in attitude towards quality

-- bad quality to be precise -- that makes the difference. Such a revolution is possible.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A few logical calculations can get you

started. Not paying enough attention to quality assurance during the initial stage of a document or

program creation, can lead you to later paying a much higher price.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let's first take one more example. Say a

person has written a holiday greeting letter describing the past year's family events and the next

year's hopes and expectations, and they replicate this letter a hundredfold to send to family and

friends. The writer knows the letter is only lighthearted and not terribly significant so doesn't

worry that a few errors in it are not caught. They were lazy in searching for errors; so what!?</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But don't you see that the 

 few errors are now, in reality, a few times a hundred errors? And an underlying 

 simultaneous belief is that when writing a serious paper, maybe scholarly, in 

 the future, they will then spend the necessary time to really concentrate and 

 be error-free. I say these expectations are unfounded. As already discussed, 

 the unpunished seemingly insignificant errors will have an invincible tendency 

 to reappear later, no matter how hard that person will try to concentrate. Slowing 

 down to concentrate later doesn't have the desired effect when a slowed-down, 

 concentrated effort is not a normal part of the brain's way of doing things. 

 A person who has rarely or never written, even copied from someone else, a standard 

 page, error-free, is not capable of writing error-free, best-quality documents 

 later.</font>
