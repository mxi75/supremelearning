  1</font></b> 

<p align="justify"><i><b>The Host:</b></i> Introducing Mr. Michael Shestov -- international investigative 

  journalist, instructor-innovator, and author of the best-selling books "Learn 

  How To Learn and Teach Ten Times More Effectively" and "Yes! You Can Master 

  Any Language", which scrupulously analyze traditional, charlatan, intensive, 

  "revolutionary", "innovative", and "accelerated" methods of studying native 

  and foreign languages. 

<p align="justify"><i><b>Michael Shestov:</b> </i>When the "aborigines" of America can hardly even dream 

  of effectively improving any level of language skills of the "regular", "old", 

  and "new" Americans, who is left to help the foreign authors of modern self-study 

  manuals and English courses master pronunciation and teach <b><i>themselves</i></b> 

  to speak and write standard American English fluently? 

<p align="justify"><i><b>The Host: </b></i>You are the author of the only learning 

  system that seems to make sense. Do you remember a story about a Dane from an 

  impoverished village who's gone to America to make money, without knowing English 

  and without any interest in learning English? That's how he never opened the 

  "door" leading to his American dream. Not everybody understands that, nowadays, 

  to open the door into America one needs to master American English as fast as 

  possible. It's not a secret that the effectivity of the methods of learning 

  and mastering American English is pretty close to zero. But judging by the tremendous 

  flow of students, <b><i>you</i></b> have "a golden key" to America. 

<p align="justify">I have two questions for you: How does one learn American English? And what 

  influenced you -- an international lecturer on educational improvement matters 

  -- to create, only a few years ago, your own speech and learning ability improvement 

  audio and video self-study courses?

<p align="justify"><i><b>Shestov:</b> </i>I was "forced" to do so by my decade-long desire to help -- 

  in a practical way -- my colleagues of many nationalities and people of different 

  ages, genders, and levels of knowledge -- especially those who couldn't attend 

  my "Learn How To Learn" public seminars, those who -- "result-free" -- attended 

  existing English-learning schools and/or couldn't follow so-called simple recommendations 

  of the books and courses. In other words, I wanted to help people by developing 

  a very comprehensive "foundation creating" course. You know, in my books I some 

  time ago described "How To Learn And Teach Properly". There was no expert to 

  be found in the field who would even try to argue against my logic; most colleagues 

  of all ranks kept silent. I took that as a clear sign of agreement with my simple 

  rules of the "Natural Law of Learning for Children and Adults".

<p align="justify">But for the last seven years something has changed. Unfortunately it's only 

  the commercials and infomercials. Now there are "fresh", smart-sounding reports 

  of great results and seeming multitudes of happy consumer references from individuals 

  who have learned or improved a language in the course of 3 to 72 hours. It's 

  odd that the wording from fellow instructors sounds an awful lot like that published 

  in my books and newspaper articles.

<p align="justify">The actual methods of instruction haven't changed, however. These "learning" 

  techniques, seemingly as old as the world itself, show up all over the place. 

  Take popular travel magazine ads asking customers to choose their own way of 

  learning from:

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>Repeating multiple times the words and grammar usages by reading books 

      and memorizing various tables, all the while being begged to "try to memorize 

      and retain" by images and look at lots of "cute" pictures of objects and 

      events,

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>Staring at the computer or TV screen so as to absorb thousands of appearing 

      and then disappearing words and sentences, some translated, some not,

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>Eating or driving, while listening and learning, and

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>Listening, following the text with your eyes, while trying to imitate the 

      professionally,<b><i>fast-speaking</i></b> narrator.

  </li>

</ul>

<p align="justify">New people contact me on a daily basis complaining that <b><i>"Hundreds of 

  repetitions of those exercises do not help!" </i></b>and that <b><i>"their psychological 

  state of mind" is flatly not being improved</i></b>.

<p align="justify">Do you remember watching youngsters (even yourself) at a school "Language Arts 

  Laboratory", trying to repeat after a narrator or an instructor -- in English, 

  French, Indonesian, whatever -- yet not capable of simulating the actual sounds 

  of those foreign languages? Even young people (14 years of age or slightly older) 

  cannot do those mass repetitions properly. Only a very small percentage of them 

  do it well enough to get their brains to comprehend, memorize, retain, and recall 

  an "abracadabra" composed from foreign sounds. Plus, most of them forget 99 

  percent of all "learned" within a year or two. We know that youngsters have 

  very "grabby", "catchy" brains -- but they still don't work the way commercials 

  promise.

<p align="justify">Okay, try to imagine yourself, <b><i>now,</i></b> being forced to make repetitious 

  incoherent rambling -- especially when almost all of the original sounds articulated 

  are pronounced erroneously -- or inattentively listening at lengths to a speaker, 

  or being requested to write/type essays you know must be full of errors, or 

  you are forced to try to primitively converse in "your new language", not at 

  all following any grammar, style, or normal (quality) sound reproduction?

<p align="justify">How often have you heard, "if you repeat it often enough, you'll eventually 

  get it"? But do you ever actually get it?

<p align="justify">Horrible, isn't it? It's like somebody is trying to teach you how to drive 

  a car while all you have at your disposal is a three-wheeled bicycle. The main 

  question and moral: How can you imitate the way your instructor speaks (or sings, 

  for that matter) if no one has previously helped you master pronunciation by 

  giving you the tools to learn or improve that particular skill?

<p align="justify">Realize that, as an adult, you are most likely totally incapable 

  of "off hand" imitating -- not only someone speaking a foreign language -- but 

  even the actors and actresses at your local theater, not to mention the professional 

  television broadcasters of your own country, speaking in <b><i>your native language</i></b>! 

  You cannot easily learn to simulate anybody of your choice -- even people in 

  your own town -- simply because you have the desire! 

<p align="center"> <b><a name="ptwo"></a><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Part 

  2 </font></b> 

<p align="justify">The stupidity of your being expected to <b><i>naturally</i></b> mimic someone 

  else is exactly what you can expect from the textbooks and courses ready to 

  "teach" you. How ambidextrous does one need to be to produce and sell, "putting 

  on" a serious face, <b><i>some randomly selected segments of video or audio 

  recorded real-speed speeches in a foreign language</i></b>& asking you to try 

  to repeat them -- simultaneously or subsequently, it's all the same, really 

  -- after professional narrators? You're promised "mountains of gold" and "big 

  success" in exchange for banal money.

<p align="justify">Education, especially in the West, has been totally commercialized. But you 

  will probably never read about it in any newspaper. You cannot learn pronunciation, 

  rhythm, or intonation at all, by trying to catch words just by listening or 

  watching. To digest it, you need to significantly slow down and go <b><i>segment 

  by segment</i></b> on an <b><i>error-free</i></b> basis.

<p align="justify">Why am I so interested in American English? Because it's the world's most difficult 

  language, considering the level of difficulty of mastering pronunciation and 

  spelling. The second most difficult language is Chinese. If you can master English, 

  you can master anything!

<p align="justify">Using any SupremeLearning materials -- whether books, videobooks, audiobooks, 

  or software -- you will be able to grab the system's essence. And on your own 

  -- as many people around the globe have already done -- you will be able to 

  learn any foreign language -- or better your own native language -- much faster.

<p align="justify">There's nothing more difficult in the world of language improvement than trying 

  to master American English -- no matter who you are, a native from a place where 

  they don't speak "standard" English, or a highly educated foreigner. Nothing 

  will help you without drastic slowing down of the learning process, attention 

  paying to each sound, and close-to correct reading out loud. Details of this 

  are disclosed in each of the SupremeLearning courses.

<p align="justify">I restate that on the world market of language learning and improving, there 

  are not many exercises or recommendations from which to choose other than:

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>Inattentive listening to instructors on audio or video recordings,

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>Relative or real speed-reading -- a hazardous process for anybody trying 

      to master any difficult language, because once you have a habit of reading 

      fast, you will never be able to master any language until your habit is 

      broken, which up until SupremeLearning came along was almost impossible,

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>Incoherent "rambling" after a professional narrator recommending that you 

      start rapidly speaking "in your new language"<b><i> prior</i></b> to your 

      having learned how to pronounce words correctly, and

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>(Whether with a businessperson's face or false enthusiasm) creating your 

      own "home made" spoken or written texts.

  </li>

</ul>

<p align="justify">These methods are being sold on the market under such slogans as:

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>"Sit back, relax, and learn",

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>"Learn languages quickly and effortlessly",

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>"Listening is all you need to do",

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>"Use the whole brain approach",

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>"Let us do for you a neuro-linguistic programming",

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>"If you want to learn how to speak, <b><i>speak!</i></b> If you want to 

      learn how to write, <b><i>write!</i></b> If you want to learn how to comprehend, 

      <b><i>listen!</i></b>"

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>"Perform deep diving into language" (meaning that no translation, not even 

      a hint, is ever offered; this is a very special kind of marketing trick 

      where the material has been composed in such a way that you will never figure 

      out the meanings of most of the words given in the course) (sometimes this 

      approach is accompanied with baroque music), and

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>"It's like having a personal trainer".

  </li>

</ul>

<p align="justify">How would <b><i>you</i></b> like to try out some "dirty" conversing by, over 

  the course of 5 hours, being inundated with a man and a woman yelling at you 

  in English like brokers on Wall Street? The main approach is for you to keep 

  speaking broken English, not to pay attention to errors, and then, sometime 

  in the future, supposedly you'll get better on your own; you'll naturally speak 

  with fewer and fewer errors.

<p align="justify">There's nothing else in the "consumer's basket" to be brought home and consumed. 

  All that "ingenious thought" of the authors of the revolutionary, accelerated, 

  rapid, fast, quick courses hasn't yet flown high. But every "popular" course 

  follows one or more of the above-described routes.

<p align="justify">Why? Nobody -- not regular people, not language instructors, not natives, not 

  foreigners -- knows how to:

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>Master pronunciation,

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>Improve vocabulary,

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>Teach perfect spelling, nor

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>Teach adults quality reading out loud, using a skill of imitating educated 

      (or any other) speech patterns.

  </li>

</ul>

<p align="justify">But without acquiring the skills of correct sound reproduction (phonetic and 

  articulation modification), standard rhythm and intonation imitation of educated 

  model speakers, no progress can be made on language improvement. That these 

  can only be learned by slowed down demonstrations of articulation patterns of 

  the actual way one can produce all those strange sounds is still not grasped 

  by teachers and students.

<p align="justify">Remember, unless you are a natural super-learner by osmosis, 

  <b><i>you are incapable of learning just by listening, watching, reading, or 

  conversing</i></b>. Starting in youth, the older you get, the more you are programmed 

  by nature to share knowledge, not to receive it. As an adult, unless you can 

  restore your learning abilities -- imitation, in particular -- to the time of 

  your childhood, you will not be able to significantly and rapidly improve your 

  American English, nor any other language, nor any other subject. 

<p align="center"> <b><a name="pthree"></a><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Part 

  3</font></b>

<p align="justify">Undoubtedly, if you haven't learned to converse as an educated person, you 

  will not be accepted in high-class society either. For the rest of your life 

  you could be considered by intelligent individuals to be a hillbilly or "that 

  dumb foreigner" -- no matter how smart your thoughts are internally. I've seen 

  it happen too often with people with higher degrees from foreign countries (whatever 

  be the native and new countries).

<p align="justify">Learning any new, or mastering any "old", skill requires, not just the learning 

  of new movements, but the <b><i>recognition</i></b> by one's brain of the <b><i>verbal</i></b> 

  descriptions of <b><i>what needs to be acquired</i></b>. Otherwise, you cannot 

  improve your language skills and you cannot learn how to learn anything effectively.

<p align="justify">One more fact: the market of language improvement is <b><i>not an area where 

  paying more gets you more</i></b>. There are only a handful of instructors -- 

  mainly, voice coaches who work with their clients one-on-one for many months 

  -- who are capable of modifying another's speech patterns. It may seem funny, 

  but in the 21st century you have <b><i>fewer</i></b> chances to really learn 

  anything than you would have had in the 19th century.

<p align="justify">American language instructors who do not flawlessly speak any language other 

  than their own should be assumed incapable of teaching foreigners English, because 

  they will likely totally misperceive the problems of any foreigner. They don't 

  know how to master their new language either. They have acquired, naturally 

  (i.e., not through books or courses, but <b><i>just by being born or living 

  in America for years</i></b>), some level of English but most of them are -- 

  <b><i>like you</i></b> -- hopelessly stuck on their same level. So they certainly 

  have no idea how to teach fellow Americans or foreigners.

<p align="justify">There are a lot of good language users in any country, but there are next to 

  no instructors who can actually pass their personal knowledge on to <b><i>adult</i></b> 

  (I repeat, older than 14) students. It's a whole different specialty in being 

  able to master a language oneself and being able to pass knowledge onto others. 

  Most grammar and stylebook creators don't even remember exactly what they have 

  written and if they don't, that means they surely have <b><i>no system of learning</i></b> 

  (e.g., memorizing) themselves!

<p align="justify">Most of them cannot apply their own written rules and principles in real life. 

  They might be expert writers, but usually are not speakers, and certainly are 

  not patient and effective teachers. They are too smart for amateur learners; 

  they don't understand their problems. The narrow specialization of teachers, 

  writers, speakers, and narrators can be partially blamed for such an unbearable 

  situation with language improvement of all kinds in the 20th, and now, in the 

  21st century. You see, all forms of language can only be mastered simultaneously. 

  Specialization prevents that.

<p align="justify">Foreigners who start learning the American version of English at ages older 

  than 14 to 16 are totally incapable of mastering that subject. No matter how 

  intelligent they are, no matter what colleges and courses from which they have 

  graduated, for the purposes of language learning, they are adults, like you. 

  They, themselves, usually need interpreters, translators, and narrators.

<p align="justify">Ask the authors of English courses from your native country to pronounce or 

  spell <b><i>any</i></b> (complex for you) words, and you will see that I'm right. 

  Try to imagine: most foreign instructors cannot even perform the exercises from 

  their own manuals! They don't want to torture themselves because they know of 

  the worthlessness. Anyone with enough money to publish commercials and produce 

  infomercials is <b><i>a perfect instructor, ready to teach</i></b>!

<p align="justify">I've been publishing my 

  articles and books for a number of years and, by now, many instructors have 

  read them. So why haven't they gotten better? If they were just lazy and didn't 

  want to improve, that would be a good explanation, but the truth is, they can't 

  master their own language skills because they aren't using the natural law of 

  learning techniques, and then they continue to shamelessly pretend that they 

  know how to teach others! 

<p align="justify">Most instructors (American 

  or foreign) have the same problem improving their own vocabularies and spelling, 

  just like any regular individual. But, in the course of the last century -- 

  <b><i>the century of fast or super-learning</i></b> -- they have <b><i>miraculously 

  learned how to sell</i></b> their courses. They are professionals at selling 

  courses even if not in instructing people. They are shoemakers who are still 

  not wearing any shoes. Most foreign authors of accelerated courses and methods, 

  for decades, haven't mastered their own American English. Something funny is 

  going on here. They are trying to convince you of the following: I'm a brilliant 

  teacher! Who cares if I can't ride a bicycle because I've taught thousands of 

  people to ride a bicycle. I don't need to demonstrate any superior skills! But 

  I can teach you superior skills. 

<p align="justify">If you create a course of 

  writing English, you must be capable of teaching writing, not just be a good 

  writer, yourself. 

<p align="justify">If you want to teach people 

  spelling, you must be an excellent speller, know how to improve your own spelling 

  skills, and know how to instruct others. 

<p align="justify">If you teach phonetics, you must know phonetics (practical 

  usage as well as the roots from which they derive) yourself. Isn't it crystal 

  clear!? Maybe it is for us, but not for language or other humanitarian subject 

  instructors. The American system of education nowadays does not exist to teach 

  people. For students' own money it allows students to learn on their own while 

  keeping "educators" posted and "clients" tested. The market has killed good 

  language instruction. When most foreigners or American parents demand from instructors 

  "just something", the system gives them that and nothing more. If people instead 

  started demanding only good quality courses and refused buying charlatan and 

  falsely revolutionary, intensive, accelerated, etc. courses, <b><i>the market 

  would create</i></b> some good quality language instruction products. For now, 

  we have to deal with amateur paraphernalia.

<p align="justify"><i><b>The Host:</b> </i>Not 

  long ago, I read the following in the international bimonthly newspaper "Top 

  Secret". This is a literal translation but I warn you that the language is sometimes 

  messy. [Bold is in original.] 

<p align="justify">"In the 70s in Bulgaria 

  under the leadership of Professor Georgi Lozanov they tried a new method of 

  stimulating the creativity of humans. About 30 volunteers were selected for 

  the experiment -- totally healthy young people. Males (intelligence service 

  officers and counterintelligence service officers), females (stewardesses). 

  They were supposed to acquire many different skills, among which were accelerated 

  courses of foreign language learning. The first results achieved were even better 

  than expected. But the experiment had to be halted: doctors found in those they 

  supervised not only neurological, but also hormonal related, disturbances. 

<p align="justify">" <b><i>'Psychotherapist 

  Professor Todor Dichev, a scholar participating in the experiment, recalls that 

  after three to five years, many of the experimentals </i></b>[student participants] 

  <b><i>got seriously ill -- physically and psychologically. Men started developing 

  a feeling of continuing premature fatigue, aggressiveness, memory gaps; step-by-step, 

  their brains were seemingly getting totally exhausted and later felt that death 

  was coming after them. Women had other kinds of unhealthy deviations: hormonal 

  changes, malignant tumors.... Different methods of treatment could help to stop 

  the processes, which were becoming only deeper. We watched the experimentals 

  during seven years, at the end of which not one of them was still alive. Can 

  you recall, that they were people with iron health...?'</i></b> 

<p align="justify">"Why did it happen? Going 

  over limits with body energy resource spending led to abatement of the immune 

  ability of the body. It was in a sense a psychoenergetic AIDS." 

<p align="justify">Could you comment on <b><i>that?</i></b> 

<p align="justify"><i><b>Shestov:</b></i> It's a tough 

  issue. The information is astonishing. I didn't know that Dr. Lozanov's research 

  had ever led to a total termination of all his "experimentals". Possibly it 

  is some formerly classified information. If you remember, in the 19th century 

  an advanced technique for acquiring a foreign language was first described by 

  Mr. Charles Berlitz. That technique was further developed by Dr. Georgi Lozanov. 

  Lozanov's techniques were widely used at Moscow University by Prof. Kitaigorodskaya 

  (one of the Soviet Union's "titans" of intensive language learning). A recent 

  rendition of that particular learning technique for acquiring a foreign language 

  was published by Paul Pimsleur. 

<p align="justify">In the last two decades, 

  Ms. Sheila Ostrander and her partners have written a number of books and created 

  and/or endorsed courses glorifying Lozanov's research, stating in one of them 

  ("SuperLearning 2000") that Dr. Lozanov is the founding father of the modern 

  accelerated methods of learning. Many American, British, Australian, etc. language 

  course authors and school organizers are seemingly very proud to mention Dr. 

  Lozanov as their mentor. I don't know the details of all results achieved by 

  Berlitz, Lozanov, and their followers, but I know that their commercials are 

  very convincing. 

<p align="justify">I want to stress one thing. 

  I always advise my colleagues (those trying to accelerate the process of learning 

  languages) "not to bend a stick or it will break" and to try -- <b><i>on themselves</i></b> 

  -- all the questionable accelerated learning techniques. The language-learning 

  process definitely needs to get accelerated. But every natural scientist must 

  be very careful -- and think twice before using new methods on their clients. 

<p align="justify">In any case, a new student 

  should not jump to a new course and start receiving big portions of information 

  immediately. They need a "warming up" period. 

<p align="justify">I've tested on myself big 

  and small portions of all the major newest methods of accelerated language learning. 

  I've come to the conclusion that an unprepared brain, in a way, is "fighting" 

  the attempts of instructors to "inject" into it any new, incomprehensible or 

  strange information -- especially when the instructors are trying to teach intensively, 

  i.e., much faster than the brain has been used to. 

<p align="justify">The brain "gets mad" when 

  forced to repeat the same "smart procedures" dozens (or even hundreds) of times. 

  Things could get especially bad when a student's brain starts distinctly saying 

  "enough", but the "natural scientist" keeps forcing the same exercise, all the 

  while the "disciples" are still seemingly stuck on the same level of speaking, 

  comprehending, conversing, and writing in the language that they are trying 

  to learn or improve. 

<p align="justify">I think, <b><i>even if</i></b> 

  the student's brain really records something as a result of using some innovative 

  accelerated learning technique created by people who do not know what they are 

  doing and haven't tried it on themselves, that "<b><i>the something</i></b>" 

  (meaning all the data "retained" by the student) is being mostly stored in the 

  brain in the <b><i>passive</i></b> form -- and we still have the case where 

  <b><i>nobody</i></b> knows how get it out of there. 

<p align="justify">In my long experience as 

  an educator and methods-maker I have learned that the more times you go through 

  the same "made up by natural scientists" exercises -- e.g., "speed-reading", 

  "speed-listening" of whatever, inferior quality "speed-talking", or "speed-writing 

  or typing" in the language one wants to improve -- the more damage may happen 

  to your brain, your health, and your ability to learn or improve any subject 

  or skill. 

<p align="justify">In addition, you may also develop some incorrect, unhealthy 

  "condition-reflexes", i.e. strong habits. For example, you could begin to "care 

  less" about your loathsome patterns of articulating sounds and spelling badly, 

  and your "monkey-like" level of comprehension of any texts (with which you would 

  be forced to work after going through an "innovative" course). An old saying 

  goes, "Repetition is the mother of learning." Well I'm here to tell you that 

  repetition can be a bad influence on learning. 

<p align="center"> <b><a name="pfive"></a><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Part 

  5</font></b>

<p align="justify"><i><b>The Host:</b></i> It's amazing 

  how well everybody understands that if you allow <b><i>anybody</i></b> (even 

  a child with a tenacious perception and ability to self-improve) to play piano 

  with errors that that person will not ever become a classical pianist! But when 

  it concerns the language improvement process with adults... 

<p align="justify"><i><b>Shestov:</b></i> Yes, unfortunately, 

  many people don't quite realize that initially inattentive listening or viewing 

  of words will always remain the same, and reading texts out loud in broken English 

  will never develop any acceptable skill of conducting a conversation. "The loathsome 

  <b><i>quantity</i></b>" will never be transformed into <b><i>quality</i></b>! 

  An adult brain is incapable of evolving in that kind of direction. Whatever 

  you have repeated incorrectly today will always be repeated by you, automatically, 

  tomorrow and in 10 years. 

<p align="justify">One must avoid multiple, 

  one-type, inferior-quality repetitions. Fast and effective American English 

  learning and improvement is impossible without acquisition of: 

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>Correct pronunciation, 

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>Creation in oneself 

      of good quality skills of imitating the patterns of educated speech, 

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>Quality (attentive) 

      reading out loud and to yourself, and 

  </li>

</ul>

<ul type="square">

  <li> 

    <p>A deferential attitude 

      towards each and every word, incorporated fully into one's life. 

  </li>

</ul>

<p align="justify"><i><b>The Host:</b> </i>It seems 

  that without a skillful instructor those needed to improve their level of American 

  English cannot do it. Everybody knows that just by studying on their own with 

  audio materials, using a regular speaking speed, and books, the system of phonetics 

  cannot be absorbed. I want to support my conclusion with a letter from your 

  student, who's obtained one of your international video and audio courses. 

<p align="center">"Maybe we should switch 

  from a car with square wheels to a car with round wheels? 

<p align="justify"> "I came to the United States 

  awhile ago. In my home country I worked as an architect. My knowledge of American 

  English was next to nothing. I wanted to find the most effective way to learn 

  English. 

<p align="justify"> "And immediately upon arrival 

  I encountered the biggest obstacle: How to read and pronounce English words. 

  Audio and video courses pay to that subject incomprehensibly 'modest' attention. 

  The international phonetic transcription (apparently first created by British 

  colonists for Indians -- because it's really primitive and imprecise) is just 

  one more -- intermediate -- form of English and itself requires an unclear amount 

  of time for learning. Books cannot speak comprehensibly and intelligibly. 

<p align="justify">"Multiple modifications 

  of speaking electronic dictionaries say words and phrases with the speed of 

  regular speech, making it impossible for any intelligent individual to catch 

  and reproduce the words correctly. 

<p align="justify">"For two months in a row 

  I kept attending one of the numerous courses where you are forced to repeat 

  after an instructor -- <i><b>anyhow you can</b></i>. This is how deformed and 

  faulty knowledge is being cooked. After such 'learning sessions' people learn 

  in-depth, not the real language, but only some rudimentary germs of English-Spanish, 

  English-Chinese, English-Russian jargon. 

<p align="justify">"I continued searching. 

  And one day I came to Michael Shestov's SupremeLearning American English center. 

  I watched and listened to the fragments of his video- and audiotapes created 

  by him and his partner. And I immediately realized: that was exactly what I 

  had really wanted to find. 

<p align="justify">"The foundation of the Shestov-Paris 

  system is learning a skill of correctly reading and pronouncing any English 

  word. That objective is being accomplished with the help of incredibly slowed 

  down -- ten to thirty times -- multiple narration (with speeds intermittently 

  changing between normal and slow) of each of the most complex English words 

  as a <i><b>part</b></i> of complex sentences. All that has been recorded by 

  Michael Shestov and professional narrators in flawless "idealized" standard 

  American English. 

<p align="justify">"Any beginner or advanced 

  learner can, segment-by-segment, <b><i>comprehend</i></b> by ear and eye, then 

  <b><i>read</i></b> and then perfectly <b><i>pronounce</i></b> any word. A new 

  ability for human beings is being born by using their organs of speech in a 

  perfect -- <b><i>from the beginning</i></b> -- manner. 

<p align="justify">"Many new avenues for self-studying 

  languages with the use of a whole arsenal of techniques and learning aids have 

  been developed by the center of Shestov-Paris. 

<p align="justify">"It still remains unclear 

  why, with such an overwhelming advantage of SupremeLearning over other existing 

  courses, it is not being widely accepted and used by the language instructors 

  around the globe. Incorporation into any course, or learning structure, even 

  a couple of elements of SupremeLearning would drastically improve its effectivity. 

<p align="justify">"Humans did not immediately 

  invent a round wheel. And now, being positioned on the seat of an automobile, 

  we are not speculating about why wheels are round. So why do the world teaching 

  institutions, at least a vast majority of them, continue trying to ride using 

  square wheels, stumbling and graduating people with damaged-from-the-beginning 

  languages of their new home? 

<p align="justify">"How many resources -- how 

  much time and energy of millions of people -- are being dissipated totally for 

  nothing? 

<p align="justify">"I think that not using 

  the SupremeLearning techniques is not the most rational way of educating people 

  in such a great country as the United States where, because of the incredible 

  effectivity of the industrial technologies, the best in the world results of 

  the economy should be the outcome as a whole." 

<p align="justify">"O. Tripolsky<br>

  Bronx, New York" 

<p align="center"> <b><a name="psix"></a><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Part 

  6</font></b> 

<p align="justify"><i><b>The Host:</b> </i>Mr. Shestov, 

  you seem to make an impression of <b><i>David trying to fight a Goliath</i></b>... 

<p align="justify"><i><b>Shestov:</b></i> I want to 

  thank Mr. Tripolsky and thousands of other SupremeLearning students for their 

  understanding, support, and acknowledgment. Yes, I <b><i>am</i></b> having a 

  difficult time trying to educate people in how American English should be learned. 

  Being a consumer advocate in this complex -- possibly even intentionally complicated 

  -- field is a tough road to hoe. 

<p align="justify">It's very hard trying to 

  help my colleagues under conditions of seemingly total "misunderstanding" of 

  the natural principles of learning (and, thus, teaching). 

<p align="justify">If I weren't an international 

  journalist, I wouldn't be able to convince even a single soul that there isn't 

  any reason to be proud or arrogant about the way American English or any other 

  foreign language is being taught nowadays. I, at least, get the word out somewhat. 

  But what about the few instructors who do actually know American English and 

  can teach, but are not able to reach their potential in teaching students, nor 

  have their achievements made public, because they don't have the forum that 

  I have? Why is it that the big corporations overlook those few instructors and 

  instead choose to sponsor only the teaching structures that propagate ineffective 

  learning methods? 

<p align="justify">For example, who would believe 

  a traditional language instructor, or a schoolteacher, if they said that Americans 

  cannot teach their own native language to a foreigner? ...That they don't understand 

  the problems of an "out-of-country" person? Your countrymen cannot teach you 

  American English because they haven't mastered it well enough, themselves, to 

  effectively teach others. 

<p align="justify">The truth is, you can buy 

  on the market only inferior quality courses created for "an uneducated mass 

  amateur customer", who will never complain. There are no effective methods of 

  humanitarian knowledge acquisition in America. All you learn, you learn on your 

  own. The amount of money you pay to instructors or language colleges matters 

  not; <b><i>you</i></b> are still <b><i>personally</i></b> forced to find the 

  necessary data, memorize it, and try to retain and use it. There are no actual 

  methods of memorizing, retention, and recall -- they only exist <b><i>in</i></b> 

  the infomercials and school prospects. There are a lot of smart commercials, 

  but up to 95 percent of foreigners, including the highest educated part -- foreign 

  journalists -- haven't learned proper English -- neither in 5, nor in 25, years 

  of living in the country! 

<p align="justify"><i><b>The Host:</b> </i>There's 

  nothing else left than to wish Americans could learn how to teach foreign American 

  English instructors to master their language skills and so forth. And now the 

  main question is, what prevents us of mastering American English? 

<p align="justify"><i><b>Shestov:</b></i> The existing 

  educational system, like Orwell's Big Brother, intentionally or not, keeps watching 

  you while trying to prevent any kind of drastic breakthroughs from talented 

  "innovative" instructors (not belonging to the accelerated mainstreams) trying 

  to spread their learning/teaching techniques. 

<p align="justify">Why? Because real teaching 

  is hard work! It seems that only using the Internet will provide equal opportunities 

  and real competition. If schools and colleges have money for commercials and 

  can attract students anyway, because, no matter what, they will get their paychecks, 

  why should they improve their learning techniques? The problem of teaching adults 

  could easily be solved, if the educational structures really wanted to. 

<p align="justify">A key also lies in the human 

  genetic code: An adult brain functions totally differently from that of a child. 

  Children naturally and effortlessly imitate behavior and speech patterns of 

  adults. But most all grown ups must be specially (re)taught those skills; they 

  don't have the imitation abilities any longer. Adults lose their abilities or 

  subconsciously resist any kind of quality imitating of other adults, whom they 

  think are their equals. Precise speakers are not considered to be the authorities 

  to follow. In fact, it is considered childlike<b><i>to</i></b> exactly copy 

  their behavioral patterns. Unfortunately no "buts" can really help: <b><i>but</i></b> 

  adults have a foundation for forming associations (associative thinking); <b><i>but</i></b> 

  they possess the basic knowledge of human history and culture; <b><i>but</i></b> 

  adults are assiduous... 

<p align="justify"><i><b>The Host:</b> </i>There is 

  a well-known story about a chimpanzee that couldn't learn how to crack nuts, 

  when he, at the age of 6, started living among his own species. He couldn't 

  learn that skill at all, despite the fact that all his fellow adult apes constantly 

  tried to demonstrate to him how that task (easy for all of <b><i>them</i></b> 

  to perform) could be accomplished. No amount of incorrect out loud repetitions 

  of text after a "model" speaker will help a student reduce their accent or learn 

  proper English. 

<p align="justify"><i><b>Shestov:</b></i> Absolutely correct! The commonly used methods of instruction 

  -- such as "enjoy your meal while learning, by listening to audiotapes or watching 

  the instructors on TV", "listen, read, and repeat along with a narrator" -- 

  without preliminary acquisition of the Americanized way of pronouncing words 

  cannot work effectively. Even thousands of hours of practice won't help one 

  make any progress! One cannot say that an adult brain works with an inferior 

  quality; it just works in a different way, following different laws of knowledge 

  acquisition. That's why teaching non-adolescent humans successfully requires 

  a different instructional approach, one that is more "perfectionistic", one 

  that is based on striving for intelligent pronunciation, rhythm, and intonation. 

  Adults need "absolute literacy", a skill had in childhood that allows the individual 

  to write and spell grammatically correctly without knowing/remembering any written 

  rules whatsoever. 

<p align="justify">An adult needs to have their 

  learning abilities -- meaning, a skill of being able to concentrate on new, 

  unfamiliar, unintelligible written or spoken data -- restored through, for example, 

  a complex improvement or total reconstruction of their ways of articulating 

  foreign sounds. Moreover, instructors need to devote to that pronunciation-mastering 

  process not just 20 to 30 minutes per day, as they usually spend, but at least 

  16 to 20 hours during a 5 to 7 day period. (All this is dependent upon using 

  correct exercises, of course.) 

<p align="justify">You see, an adult shall 

  not be allowed to pronounce and write down foreign words incorrectly. But <b><i>that</i></b> 

  goal can only be reached by drastically slowing down the speed of presenting 

  the learning materials -- to even as slow as <b><i>1 word per minute</i></b> 

  -- while, using any available means, providing quality work on the mouth muscles 

  and vocal cords, or through, for example, the style of writing being bettered 

  on a computer keyboard. 

<p align="justify">How can we implement that 

  scheme? Any error that is easily noticed in the classroom or at home shall be 

  "punished" by making students repeat the entire mini-exercise all over again. 

  Until pronunciation has been truly mastered, they should not be allowed to say 

  loudly any imperfectly pronounced words. The most important issue to address 

  is adults' being helped to regain their ability to learn; that is, they need 

  help in acquiring the skill of quality imitation of any strange flawless mouth 

  muscle movements and error-free copying of grammatically perfect written texts. 

<p align="justify">I would like to stress the 

  following: <b><i>all</i></b> American English courses -- whether geared towards 

  learning from scratch or towards improving some level -- must begin with introductory 

  phonetic-articulatory learning sessions (classes), conducted by language instructors 

  <b><i>exclusively on an error-free basis</i></b>. Only then, may the student 

  be allowed to study in the "audio-language laboratory" or at home with headphones 

  in their ears to absorb grammar, style, polysemantics of words, etc. Dramatically 

  reading out loud the complex, professionally required texts and other types 

  of exercises must also accompany the regimen. 

<p align="justify">Those who acquired English 

  "the natural way", by learning English in America from an early age (the same 

  way an American boy or girl does) don't understand the problems of their former 

  countrymen; thus they are likely incapable of translating well from and into 

  English, and of teaching others! In their heads have been formed two independent 

  "language archives".<b><i> If you</i></b>, as a foreigner, after taking any 

  of the routinely primitive (auditory or self-study) language classes, <b><i>would 

  have learned</i></b> something, but would have acquired simultaneously a "habit" 

  of "switching off" (while conversing with Americans) your native language archive, 

  your brain would forever be capable of operating <b><i>only</i></b> with that, 

  inferior quality, primitive vocabulary! Your brain will not be able (during 

  any "regular speed" conversation) to extract any knowledge from your previous 

  "foreign" life experience! Most intelligent foreigners will not settle for that 

  kind of "low in intellectual calories" vocabulary "ration".
