  MAGAZINE INTERVIEW</b></font> 

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Val Vanderpool</font>

<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amongst the obsessive oyster opening

and assiduous seed spitting, it's impossible to find a category in the Guinness Book of Records that

can be considered intellectual -- right? Well, meet Michael Shestov, keyboarding phenomenon, who

holds one such world record.</font></b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Shestov isn't just the world's fastest

typist, but a person who shows deftness on any keyboard, whether it be a newfangled, split computer

keyboard which is mounted onto the arms of a chair, or the keyboard of a stately grand piano.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How can one person be the grand master of

computer keyboards, typing error-free in 27 languages with speeds reaching 200 words per minute,

while also possessing the ability to play Rakhmaninov and Bach with heart-wrenching emotion? I had

the unique chance to discover the answers by talking with the distinguished maestro himself at a Las

Vegas convention center during COMDEX, the largest computer trade show in the world.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Beat USA:</i> To what do you

attribute your extraordinary talents?</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Michael Shestov:</i> Working very

hard, not taking vacations, always doubting what was written in textbooks, and concentrating on the

desire to be the best.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Beat:</i> What is the link between

two so seemingly different areas such as music and computer keyboarding?</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Shestov:</i> The time needed to

spend developing useful skills, normally taking up to 7 years. But for musicians and keyboardists,

even after years of study and use, one still has no guarantee that they'll become very productive.

With the system I developed to train one's hands and of course brain, people learn in weeks rather

than years to use a simple set of rules and exercises -- and everyone's dream of being great becomes

a reality.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Beat:</i> Can your system be

taught to children and adult beginners?</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Shestov:</i> Absolutely. That's

the easy part. All music and keyboarding classes claim to be able to do that. The difference is that

other systems can be mostly effective only with young people. During the development of my system, I

always had the desire to be able to not only teach the average person, but to teach people of all

ages and all levels of knowledge, especially those who are often left out -- the people whom others

claim to be impossible to teach. In the eighties, most of my European students were people of middle

and older ages who had graduated from other courses, yet hadn't obtained any useful knowledge.

Before enrolling in my course they thought they had lost their last hope to ever become productive.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Beat:</i> So what about people who

already play piano or regularly use computers and are stuck in their own inefficient, yet persistent

habits -- can they really be retaught?</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Shestov:</i> Thank you for raising

the most important question. Discussing my knowledge of how to reteach people with deeply rooted

habits brings to light the biggest difference between my method and all others. I can teach anybody

at any stage of their professional development to adapt the ergonomically correct set of rules,

which will drastically improve their productivity. I want to add that for most people, this process

involves only a slight correction and is integrated into their lives quite painlessly.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Beat:</i> I hold in my 

  hand an official statement, published in 1987, which declares your system to 

  be the best in the world. Is it still true?</font> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Shestov:</i> It is weird, but

since that time, my system has been discussed in media all around the world and to my knowledge, no

one has ever attempted to say that any system even comes close to being as efficient, much less

being more so. I am still able to say that my keyboarding class, for example, is at least ten times

faster and twice as efficient as any traditional one. And musicians can sometimes work pretty hard

with their particular instrument, but not get the expected nor desired results. I say that if a

teaching strategy is wrong, no amount of practice will allow one to get better, because in that

case, the student is not really getting taught; they end up trying to invent their own individual

way of getting better, which of course is unreal. The Internet finally allows a widespread

dissemination of exciting learning technologies. With the advent of Internet downloading, everybody

now has the opportunity to teach and learn the best systems, in a very efficient way.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Beat:</i> How did your method

first become known?</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Shestov:</i> When I was 24, I gave

a single demonstration of my skills in the office of the international book of records and

phenomenon, "Marvel". My style of working looked so different and seemed so easy to

perform, that within in a week I was greatly promoted. Journalists and countless number of experts

started raising the interest of the general population and within 1 year it had been discussed by

the media in more than 70 languages. In the last 7 years, my assistants and I have personally taught

thousands of people from various countries.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Beat:</i> You have just set new

Guinness and Marvel book keyboarding world records at COMDEX. How do you practice for such a feat?

[The Marvel book is similar to the Guinness Book of Records, yet also contains other unique and

amazing facts.]</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Shestov:</i> It was actually quite

easy.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Beat:</i> Easy?</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Shestov:</i> Yes. Once I obtained

the high standard of working, which I still use today, I can simply use a small set of warming up

exercises to get back to my original level, even without everyday practicing. And it's the same for

my students. The concept can be applied by all musicians and computer users. In contrast, take Van

Clybern, the pianist famous in both Russia and America, who spent many years developing his amazing

skills. Only after spending 6 hours a day practicing, did it become easy to maintain his high level

without playing on a regular basis. This is true for most highly recognized performers. And then

there's the main problem that they have no way to teach more than possibly a few others to do the

same. I can teach hundreds of people to perform at a high level in a matter of weeks.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Beat:</i> What is next in store

for you?</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Shestov:</i> I spent several years

writing parts of a book, which mostly uses examples from Europe and America. Working in cooperation

with my American partner, co-author, and editor, Gin I. Paris, it will be possible to make the book

available for the general public in English and other languages. (Isn't it wonderful how the

Internet can make information so easily accessible to the worldwide public?) The book will share

lots of advice, which journalists, programmers, keyboardists, and others can immediately apply to

real life. They'll learn about creating and bettering a daily-based, self-training process, and how

to maintain the highest possible level of performance. But children are of significant importance to

me. Through the popularization of other's extraordinary achievements and by intensifying the

cultural exchange between the youth of America and other countries, I want to help the children of

all countries discover their own creativity. I believe strongly in helping kids develop themselves

intellectually.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Beat:</i> You're the maestro of

keyboards, but what do you actually do for a living?</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Shestov:</i> I am a journalist,

lecturer, consultant for various government agencies, and teacher of the method to use computers and

musical instruments in the most efficient way. I work in a capacity as a consumer advocate for

computer users, recommending the best innovations in ergonomic computer and office products and the

ergonomically correct way to use those products. And I have consulted musicians of the organ,

accordion, flute, and even guitar. But I have to add an interesting point that while I talk about

development in a very short amount of time, of the dexterity of the fingers, hands, and even brain,

I don't teach one how to play with soul. I can prepare an excellent musician or computer

keyboardist, but to become famous, it's solidly up to that person.</font>

as a clerk in the army, typing eight hours a day. As the clock ticks down...</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Scene:</i> Close-up of PC monitor.

The right of the "Time Left" field on the screen shows 206, 205, 204, 203.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Moos:</i> ...Shestov's tally heads

ever closer to breaking the magic eight-hundred.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Scene:</i> Close-up of PC monitor.

To the right of the current number being typed field, the numbers quickly change from 797, to 798,

799, 800, 801, then 838, while to the right of the last number correctly typed field, the numbers

change from 796, to 797, 798, 799, 800, 801. Then, suddenly, nothing is changing any more.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Moos:</i> It takes a second to

sink in... (...the fact that Shestov actually broke the world record)</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Scene:</i> A blowing sound comes

from Shestov. View expands from PC monitor to include Shestov who has stopped typing. Applause and

shouts of "yeah's" come from the audience. Shestov turns away from the PC, gets up, blows

and puffs out his cheeks, while he has his hand on the front of his chest.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Moos:</i> The typing class was

sure impressed.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Scene:</i> View of students and

teacher. Everyone is smiling and clapping. Cut to view of administrator.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Administrator:</i> Calm, cool,

collected -- and a speed demon!</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Scene:</i> Shestov, standing,

looking a little glazed and amazed.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Moos:</i> Did she say, "calm,

cool, and collected?"</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Shestov:</i> Oh my God.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Moos:</i> Better relax at the

other keyboard.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Scene:</i> Front full view of

Shestov sitting at a dark grand piano, playing. Cut to over-the-shoulder, close-up view of Shestov's

hands playing Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata." Cut to very close, close-up view of

Shestov's hands typing at a PC keyboard.</font>
